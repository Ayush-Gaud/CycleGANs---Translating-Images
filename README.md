# CycleGANs---Translating-Images

Implemented a CycleGAN to translate unpaired images between summer and winter landscapes. The project covers foundational ML concepts, builds up to CNNs and GANs, and applies advanced losses—cycle consistency, identity, and adversarial—for realistic domain mapping. Includes models like DCGAN, cGAN, Pix2Pix, and CycleGAN with hands-on image translation assignments.
